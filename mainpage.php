		<p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the pre-eminent men's professional basketball league in North America,
		 and is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world. It has 30 teams 
		(29 in the United States and 1 in Canada), and is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB),
		 which is recognized by FIBA (also known as the International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for 
		basketball in the United States. The NBA is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and 
		Canada. NBA players are the world's best paid sportsmen, by average annual salary per player.
		The Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern
		and Midwestern United States and Canada. On November 1, 1946, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted 
		the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens, in a game the NBA now regards as the first played in its history.
		The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at
		professional basketball leagues, including the American Basketball League and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to 
		attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities.</p>
